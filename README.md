# SP-500-TweetIDs
The repository contains an ongoing collection of tweets IDs of S&amp;P 500 companies and their tweets' comments, which commenced on January 1, 2020.
We used the Twitter's usertimeline API to gather the S&P 500 companies' history tweets, which contains 2400 tweets back from Janary 1, 2020. And also used Twitter's search API to get their tweets from the preceding 7 days. 

About the comments. Based on the companies' tweets we collected, we hydrated the tweet ID and then use Twitter's search API to get the comments for the tweets from the preceding 7 days, leading to the first Tweets in our dataset dating back to January 1,2020.

To comply with Twitterâ€™s Terms of Service, we are only publicly releasing the Tweet IDs of the collected Tweets. The data is released for non-commercial research use.
